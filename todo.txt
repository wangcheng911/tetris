To-dos:

1. Merge backupGrid() and drawGrid(). Try to delete backupGrid() and g_GRID_BAK,
  then add attribution "modified" to g_GRID[][]. In drawGrid(), only redraw
  the position which "modified" is true.

2. Make createShape() create Shape with random Shape->types.

3. Optimize NEXT CUBE display.

âˆš 4. Bonus if eliminate more than one line.
